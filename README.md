# Number Guessing Game
Hello, this is my re-edition of  a number guessing game. A game where users have 5 attempts to guess the number right? Well, I made the challenge range from 1 to 1,000 but gave hints at the third attempt to help  the user out.
I was given a challange to create this game by a good friend of mine to create this game in any choice of language(Java).
I took it a step further and added HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make the GUI visually appealing to the eye and upload so anyone can play within their browser on all devices.
